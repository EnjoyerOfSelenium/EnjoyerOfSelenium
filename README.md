ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @EnjoyerOfSelenium! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a chem undegrad student that occasionally models physical phenomena. I'm pretty busy though so this place will probably be quiet for the time being.

Currently I know much of Python (including a good chunk of MatPlotLib, NumPy and , Pandas) along with some basic C# and bash scripting. Eventually, I want to at least experiment with C++, Julia, and Rust.

I keep forgetting Selenium is an actual web dev software. I'm sure it's good! However, my username refers to the chemical element.

Pronouns: He/Him, They/Them is OK.
